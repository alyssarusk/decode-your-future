# Turtles Activity 

1. Visual studio code should be open with the turtle demo project
    - Ensure font size on VS Code is set to 14 pt font or something sufficiently easy to see 
    - Ensure code and terminal can be seen
2. Explain starter code to students and show where they can add code to move their turtle
3. Explain basic turtle commands to students for how to move turtle, turn, select colours, fill with colour, etc.

    - Digital copy of the handout can be found here: [Turtles Handout](https://github.com/alyssarusk/decode-your-future/blob/main/Handouts/TurtlesHandout.pdf)
