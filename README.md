# Decode Your Future Event 

Activities to be run at the FAS Outreach booth at the Decode Your Future Event: 
- Password Cracker
- Turtles

Have a minimum of one laptop set up for each activity so that students may try both. Highlight the range of topics that Computer Science can cover. 

Instructions for both activities can be found in the `Instructions` folder and the base code needed for each activity can be found in the `StarterCode` folder.
